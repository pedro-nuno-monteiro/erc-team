 * It validates each parameter to ensure they meet the required conditions and outputs error messages if any parameter is invalid. 
 * If any issue is encountered, the function exits with `EXIT_FAILURE`.

 * @brief Prompts the user for simulation parameters, validates inputs, and writes to an input file.
 *
 * This function collects all necessary simulation parameters from the user, validating each one to ensure 
 * it meets the required conditions. If any parameter is invalid, it prompts the user to re-enter a valid value. 
 * After all values are correctly entered, it writes the parameters and random seeds to the input file.
 *
 * The parameters collected include:
 * - Number of servers
 * - Mean interarrival time
 * - Mean service time
 * - Number of costumers (delays) required
 * - Queue option (without queue or infinite queue)
 * 
 * This function also calculates the offered traffic load (`A`) based on the interarrival and service times, 
 * and ensures it is less than the number of servers. It calls `ask_streams` to collect random seeds and 
 * `generate_other_streams` to generate additional seeds for each server.
 *
 * @param files Pointer to the Files structure that holds the input file pointer.
 * @param q Pointer to the circular queue structure.
 * @param init Pointer to the InitialValues structure that will store the random seeds.

 * @brief Calculates the blocking probability in an M/M/n/0 system using the Erlang-B formula.
 *
 * This function computes the blocking probability (or costumer loss) in an M/M/n/0 queuing system, where costumers arrive according to a Poisson process and are served by `n` servers. The calculation is based on the Erlang-B formula, which uses the offered traffic `A` (arrival rate multiplied by the average service time) and the number of channels `n` (the number of servers) to determine the probability of a costumer being rejected (blocked).
 *
 * The Erlang-B formula is especially used for loss systems, where there is no waiting queue, and costumers are rejected if all servers are busy.
 *
 * @param A The offered traffic to the system, which is the arrival rate multiplied by the average service time (A = λ * T).
 * @param n The number of channels (servers) available in the system.
 * @return The blocking probability (costumer loss) in the M/M/n/0 system.

 * @brief Calculates the confidence interval for a given sample using the t-distribution.
 *
 * This function computes the confidence interval for a set of values, based on the t-distribution, which is commonly used when the sample size is small and the population variance is unknown. The calculation uses the sample mean, standard deviation, and a critical value from the t-distribution (from a file `t_student_95.txt`) to determine the interval around the sample mean that would contain the true population mean with a certain level of confidence.
 * 
 * The confidence interval is calculated using the formula:
 * 
 *      CI = [mean - (t * (std_dev / sqrt(n))), mean + (t * (std_dev / sqrt(n)))]
 *
 * Where:
 * - `mean` is the average of the sample values.
 * - `t` is the critical value from the t-distribution for a 95% confidence level.
 * - `std_dev` is the standard deviation of the sample.
 * - `n` is the number of samples.
 *
 * The critical value `t` is read from a file containing t-distribution values for the desired confidence level (95% in this case).
 *
 * @param array The array containing the sample data.
 * @param init A pointer to an `InitialValues` structure, which holds the number of repetitions (`number_of_reps`) for the sample.
 * @param inferior A pointer to a float that will hold the lower bound of the confidence interval.
 * @param superior A pointer to a float that will hold the upper bound of the confidence interval.
